## Customer & Product Analytics Project

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills using real business-style datasets.
I designed and executed a structured analysis workflow to explore customer behavior, product performance, and business trends using SQL.

The goal of this project was to simulate a real business analytics environment and build actionable insights that support decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives :

- Analyze customer and product-level performance

- Build trend and cumulative growth insights

- Identify key segments and contribution patterns

- Transform raw data into meaningful business metrics

- Deliver insights in a clear and structured way


🧠Key Business Questions Answered :

- How do key performance metrics change over time?

- What is the cumulative impact of customer and product activities?

- Which products and customer groups drive the most value?

- What segments show the strongest performance trends?

- How does each category contribute to the overall business?
